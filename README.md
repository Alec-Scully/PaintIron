This is an online pixel-paint application that allows users to save their own pixel paint boards, as well as painting on public boards with other users!!!

You can find a video demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4feCT_sOTQ).

This repo was my [Flatiron](www.flatironschool.com) phase 4 project. This repo has both the frontend and the backend in one folder.

If you want to run the application yourself, follow these directions:
In paintiron-client:
``` javascript
  npm install
  npm start
```

In paintiron-backend:
``` javascript
  rails db:migrate
  rails db:seed
  rails s
```
